```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

For your assignments you are expected to turn in an _R Markdown file_ `.Rmd` and a "knitted" `.pdf`, formatted as a human readable report.  This introduction to R Markdown is designed to quickly get you up and running.

**NOTE:** *It is not acceptable to simply dump your `.R` code into an `.Rmd` file and knit it.*

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(CO2)
summary(CO2)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r CO2, echo=FALSE}
plot(uptake~Treatment, data=CO2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## Markdown

Text (like this) is written in (Markdown)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown], which is a lightweight markup language that is widely used for creating formatted text with plain-text editor.  R uses [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html), which is a slight extension of ordinary Markdown.  

Here is short guide to formatting text.
